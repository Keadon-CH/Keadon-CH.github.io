    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>*Please note* The parks are represented in blue, and the stations in either red, yellow or green.<br /> In this spatial analysis project, I pulled data from Metrolix and the city of Toronto to obtain the locations of parks and transit stations.<br />
        I then categorized the stations in one of three categories: Low(red), Moderate(yellow) and High(green). The criteria for these categories were as follows: high if a station is within 200 meters of a public park, moderate if a station is between 200 and 500 meters of a public park, and low if a station is more than 500 meters away from a public park.<br><br>
        The station dataset from metrolinx included all stations in the GTA as well as stations that do not exist yet such as the Ontario line.<br />Because I only wanted to focus on existing stations within Toronto, I filtered the dataset to remove the ones still in the planning phase as well as the ones located outside of Toronto. I then utilized a built-in distance matrix function to obtain all the distances between each station and its nearest park.
        Finally, I assigned the category based on the distance between the station and its closest public park and assigned the colour accordingly. I am still working to make the map more interactive on the website. </p>
